[HAL](https://hal.science) is the French National repository for publications. 
According to the French Law, every researcher has the right, whatever be the contract they have signed with the publisher, to store the Author Accepted Manuscript in this repository as early as 6 months after its publication in Hard Sciences or 12 months in Social and Human Sciences

HAL gives you the opportunity to store all your publications and their related source code in open access and to edit a thorough curriculum of your research activity from these works, which is known as a HAL CV.

this CV HAL can be used to certify a [[Mastodon]] account
